### **Build your React tacit knowledge**

A curated collection of React projects by smart developers

### The Problem ###

You learned React not so long ago, but you feel like you know how to write React apps well. useEffect and useContext are your friends and somehow, you got invited to that secret Sr. devs project that is being built with React

It’s your first day and you start reading the codebase and it looks like nothing you’ve seen before, but somehow you understand it all. You think to yourself, “holy sh*t, this is beautiful”. “How did they come up with this pattern?, it would have never occurred to me to do it this way”. It makes your old React code look like an Italian dish (yes, spaghetti).

Next day, you team up with one of the Sr. devs and you ask her some questions like, why did you code it this way? How did you come up with this pattern? And the only answers you get are; "I don’t know really", "it just feels right to write it this way" or the now mythical “I just know”.

This is called **tacit knowledge**. Knowledge that **is really hard to describe** or to teach someone else. Knowledge that just feels right. **Tacit knowledge is not transferred but built**, and the only way to build it is to read a lot of code written by smart people, process it, understand it, think and understand the why behind it and finally replicate it.

### The Solution

This repo gathers open sourced React projects built by smart Sr. devs. Reading through their code will help you improve your React game and build your tacit knowledge.

I hope this helps you get faster to that point in time when you catch yourself saying "I don't know really, it just felt right" and realize that "you just know".

Feel free to add cool projects to the list.
